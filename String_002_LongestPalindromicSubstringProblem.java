public class String_002_LongestPalindromicSubstringProblem {
    /*
    Given a string, find the maximum length contiguous substring of it that is also a palindrome. For example, the
    longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

    The problem differs from the problem of finding the longest palindromic subsequence. Unlike subsequences, substrings
    in a string abracadabra with a length greater than three. Still, there are two palindromic substrings with length
    tree, namely aca and ada. If multiple longest palindromic substrings exists, return any one of them.

    The dynamic programming solution for this problem takes O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space. This post will discuss another
    approach to solve this problem that doesn't require any extra space.

    The idea is simple and effective - for each character in the given string, consider it the midpoint of a palindrome
    and expand in both directions to find the maximum length palindrome. For an even length palindrome, consider every
    adjacent pair of characters as the midpoint.
